    <h4>Delicious vegetarian sauce for pasta, so tasty, and as nice as a meat bolognese. It can also be served with potatoes.</h4>
    <h5>STEP 1</h5>
    <p>Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Cook and stir onion and garlic until soft, about 5 minutes. Stir in red bell pepper and carrot; cook for 4 to 5 minutes. Add mushrooms; cook and stir until softened, about 2 minutes.</p>
    <h5>STEP 2</h5>
    <p>Pour wine into the pot; simmer until slightly reduced, about 1 minute. Stir in diced tomatoes and vegetable broth. Bring sauce to a boil; reduce heat and simmer until flavors combine, 10 to 15 minutes. Stir in lentils, paprika, basil, oregano, dried herbs, and nutmeg; cook until lentils are heated through, about 5 minutes.</p>
